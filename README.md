- 👋 Hi, I’m @Aurinimac - some of you might know me as Shahariel from Idrinth's discord. 
- 👀 I’m interested in modding Skyrim - ok, mostly writing lines for modders.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to actually use the Creation Kit. It's... slow work.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on writing more lines for Idrinth and Idrinth's voiced weapons -especially the sword
- 📫 How to reach me  - erm... good question.
